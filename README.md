# Customer_Assistant_AI
Businesses often face the challenge of handling a large volume of customer inquiries. These queries can range from mundane questions like “What is the status of my order?” to more complex issues requiring human intervention. The sheer volume of repetitive queries can overwhelm customer support teams, leading to longer response times and reduced customer satisfaction. Additionally, utilizing human resources for simple, routine queries is inefficient and costly. There’s a growing need for automated solutions that can handle routine queries effectively, allowing human agents to focus on escalated cases that require nuanced problem-solving.

Solution: Use LLM Agents and Amazon Bedrock to Solve Customer Queries with AI
  
Our Agent can perform following actions:

- Respond to common customer queries(e.g., order status, return policy)
- Acces and retrieve user data from a database
- Perform simple opearions like viewing order status, updating customer informations.
  
Boundaries:

- The agent should not execute actions that require human judgment, such as processing refunds or handling escalations.
- It should operate within the defined scope and not access sensitive data unless explicitly permitted.
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms should be in place for unsupported queries.
